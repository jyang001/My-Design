                        Conscription in South Korea has existed since 1957 and requires male citizens between the ages of 18 and 35 to perform compulsory military service. Women are not required to perform military service, but they may voluntarily join the military.

                    <p>
                        The legal drinking age in South Korea is 20 years old in Korean age. This is also the age that you have to be to enter most night clubs in Korea. What does this mean for you? The legal drinking age in Korea for foreigners is 19 years of age for most people.                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One of the common facts is that Koreans think there is some significance to their blood type. Their neighbors in Japan are also similar in that way. While people in other countries may or may not know their blood type, every South Korean certainly does know theirs.                    </p>
