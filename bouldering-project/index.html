                    <p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing performed without ropes or harnesses, typically on shorter walls or natural rock formations. It focuses on solving short, challenging routes called "problems" using a combination of strength, technique, and problem-solving skills. Bouldering is a popular activity both indoors at climbing gyms and outdoors on natural rock formations.</p>
                    <p>Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_climbing">Sport Climbing</a> or trad climbing, bouldering doesn't involve ropes or harnesses, focusing instead on shorter, more powerful movements on smaller, lower walls</p>

                    <span>It's a great workout. It's a sport in which you're only competing against yourself. This makes it so that every bit of progress means self improvement. The community is great. I'm somewhat shy, but in the bouldering gym I can talk to whoever, it's really a welcoming community.</span>
